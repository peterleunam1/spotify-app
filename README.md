# SPOTIFY-APP

## Note on Spotify API Access

This application is part of a technical test and is currently in **development mode**, which restricts access to approved users in the **Spotify Developer Dashboard**.  

To evaluate it without restrictions, the production access request must be approved in the Spotify dashboard. The application will not be used in a real production environment but solely for testing purposes, allowing any Spotify account to authenticate and test its functionality.

## Inspiration
This app is inspired by the [Spotify UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/design/eFrlbCLS6zHD9xGj7RmSse/Spotify-UI---Free-UI-Kit-(Recreated)-(Community)?node-id=0-346&t=1BPhx9bfPPgAnpI6-0) from Figma. It follows a similar design and layout, providing a clean and user-friendly interface to navigate through music-related content.
